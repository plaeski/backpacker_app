## Synopsis

This was our final project for the Lighthouse Labs' full stack web development bootcamp. It attempts to bring travellers together via their existing social network to plan independant travel.

## Motivation

Having planned travel with friends via facebook messages or email, we realized that information often gets lost and that the experience is often frustrating. By having somewhere to aggregate information, we take the possibility of losing or forgetting information out of the equation. 

## Stack

This project was built with Ruby on Rails with various React components. 
This also integrates D3 Maps, Google Currency API, Google Maps API, OAuth.

## Installation

1. Install Dependencies - bundle install
